Application utilizes [IBM BlueMixâ„¢](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/) and Texas Instruments [CC2541 SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2541dk-sensor)

With this application you can set tresholds to temperature (C), humidity (%) and for pressure (mbar) and it will also store the values to temp file in `/tmp/sensor.log` and also to MongoDB in BlueMix.

## Requirements

* OS: OSX/Linux
* TI CC2541 SensorTag
* BlueMix account
    * Internet of Things (IoT) service with apikey
    * MonboLab service


## Setup
* Login to BlueMix
